    Q : Are credit cards widely accepted? Would you recommend bringing Travelers Checks, cash or credit cards?

          <p>
            Although most stores and restaurants will accept Visa, MasterCard and American Express cards, travelers should keep in mind that Japan is still very much a cash culture. You may find smaller shops or remote ryokan hotels that only accept yen in cash. More than 26,000 Post Office ATMs exist at various locations throughout Japan, and stickers indicate whether a Post Office has an ATM machine. Cirrus, Plus, Maestro and Visa Electron networks are accepted, as are Visa, MasterCard, American Express and Diners Club credit cards.

            Japan has one of the lowest crime rates in the world, so carrying cash is not a real problem. Travelers Checks are also an option, although it is wise to have these available in either Japanese yen, or US dollars. Travelers Checks may not be accepted outside of major hotels and banks.

          <p>
            This can vary depending on your network provider. Before arriving in Japan, make sure to confirm the compatibility of your mobile phone with your phone line service provider. It is worth noting that rental phones, sim cards and Wi-Fi are available in Japan on varying plans and costs. Most major airports have kiosks offering these services. Do your research to find out what makes the most sense for you.

 <button class="accordion">  <h2>Q : Will travel in Japan be difficult without Japanese language skills?</h2>
 </button>
 <div class="panel">
      
          <p>
            Traveling in a country where you don't speak the language can be both challenging and rewarding. Even if you don't speak any Japanese, finding your way around Japan shouldn't be too difficult. English is generally understood throughout the country, particularly in major cities and tourist centers. Combine this with some positive body language and gestures, and you shouldn't encounter many problems. Public transportation announcements are frequently made in both Japanese and English, and signs generally include decipherable roman characters or English explanations. A comprehensive range of tourist services also provide a helping hand to foreign visitors in Japan.
