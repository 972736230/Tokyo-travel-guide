            Tokyo is home to a very large number of museums. The National Museum of Tokyo is the most famous one. Located within the large park of Ueno, it is Japan's oldest museum in Japan. Take a plunge into the history of art: the museum has an impressive collection through which you will (re)discover ancient Japan.
          </p>

          <p>
            The Nezu Museum hosts the private collection of Kaichirô Nezu, a businessman who made a fortune in the industrial sector by investing massively in the railways (mid 19th, early 20th). A few steps away from Omotesando, the museum offers a contemplative break: calligraphies, kimonos, etc. It also has a garden which acts as an oxygen bubble in the heart of hectic Omotesando.
          </p>
            <p>Tokyo is the ideal place for artists. MOMAT and MOT are famous for their contemporary architecture. MOMAT (National Museum of Modern Art) is quite renowned unlike the MOT (Museum of Contemporary Art). In addition to sculptures and paintings, it also hosts fashion and design exhibitions, workshops, conferences, etc. The museum aims to bring life to art and is constantly evolving and innovating.</p>

            Green areas in the heart of hyper-urbanization, parks and gardens are popular with joggers, walkers, etc. Two seasons are particularly famous: spring and autumn. In spring, people gather for the Hanami which translated into admiring flowers. The Sakura, the Japanese cherry tree, blooms in spring. Hanami, which is many centuries old, is a social activity. Locals have picnics under the cherry trees, meet up and discuss. It is an excellent opportunity for sharing.
          </p>

          <p>
            In autumn, trees are decorated with beautiful reddish leaves - the Kôyô. The Japanese particularly appreciate maple leaves, which take on beautiful shades ranging from orange to red. In Tokyo, gardens take on an almost magical look, and some even organise special exhibitions, like the Rikugien garden. This traditional garden, in the lineage of Edo gardens, opens its doors in the evening, for a unique show. The red leaves of the trees are springing up with light shows. Many people come to admire these illuminations.

            In Tokyo, the Matsuri, seasons are marked by feasts or festivals. Each season is celebrated. In spring, the people celebrate the Sakura. In addition to the Hanami, many events take place in the different districts of Tokyo to welcome the rebirth of vegetation.
          </p>
          <p>In summer, the number of Matsuri doubles: many are dedicated to music, culture, discovering a region, etc. These feasts include the beautiful Tanabata, the "star festival". It takes place on July 7 and pays tribute to the impossible love of Vega and Altair, forced to see each other only once a year - on the seventh day of the seventh month.</p>
