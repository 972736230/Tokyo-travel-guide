            From late March to early April, Tokyo transforms as cherry blossom
            fever grips the city. We introduce the latest 2022 forecast and the
            best spots to enjoy these beautiful symbols of spring. Cherry
            blossom – or sakura - season in Tokyo is truly a magical experience.
            Thousands of trees burst into bloom, dousing the streets with
            stunning shades of pink. The flowers are a national obsession and
            people flock to parks to hold hanami parties and picnics to view and
            photograph them. Stores will stock their shelves with sakura-themed
            or flavored items, such as sakura bento lunch boxes and even serve
            pink sakura drinks. As if shaking off the winter, a bright and
            optimistic atmosphere fills the city.

          <h4>
            Best sakura festivals and cherry blossom viewing spots in Tokyo
          </h4>
          <p>
            Tokyo is full of well-known as well as hidden spots for viewing
            blossoms. However, for the full hanami experience, soak up the
            vibrant atmosphere of a festival. We’ve selected seven popular
            events where you can admire the flowers’ ephemeral beauty and join
            Tokyoites in having fun and welcoming the spring.

          <p>
            There is a word in Japanese known as “yozakura” and it is definitely
            something worth experiencing. Literally, “night sakura”, the
            blossoms are lit up in night crating an otherworldly ethereal scene
            that is hauntingly beautiful. One of the best examples is the
            weeping cherry at Rikugien. The gardens were constructed in 1702 by
            Yanagisawa Yoshiyasu, a feudal lord and vassal to the shogun
            (military commander), who was inspired by the picturesque scenes in
            waka poetry. Walking past the front gate within the gardens brings
            into view an impressive 70-year-old shidarezakura (weeping cherry
            blossom) tree. Even today, its branches are covered in pale pink
            flowers during cherry blossom season, cascading downwards like a
            waterfall.

          <p>
            You may have noticed that cherry blossoms often line the moats of
            castles and canals, their reflections amplifying the spectacle.
            Sumida River in the east of Tokyo is no exception. During the Edo
            period, Yoshimune, the eighth Tokugawa shogun (military commander),
            ordered the planting of sakura along both banks, forming a
            kilometer-long sakura boulevard running from Azumabashi Bridge to
            Sakurabashi Bridge. This has attracted large crowds for centuries.
            Nowadays, local councils and businesses set up booths, and even
            tourism associations flaunt beautiful locations, so you can start
            dreaming of your next trip. At night time, the blossoms are lit up
            with the added bonus of Tokyo Skytree in the background.

             <div class="panel">
          <p>
            Just north of the Imperial Palace, the Chidorigafuchi Green Way
            provides a peaceful path away from the bustle of the city and, in
            spring, it becomes a 700-meter-long cherry tree tunnel. Around 260
            trees of the Somei-yoshino and Oshima varieties are illuminated at
            dusk. The Chidorigafuchi boating area is also open late during the
            festival so that visitors can view this magical sight from the
            water. Many neighboring shops and local organizations also hold
            sakura-themed events, adding to the spring festival atmosphere.
